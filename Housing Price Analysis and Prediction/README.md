# Housing Price Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project performs a full data analysis and machine learning pipeline on a housing dataset.

The objective is to understand pricing patterns and build a predictive model that estimates housing prices with strong accuracy.  


## Dataset
The dataset contains housing attributes such as Square_Footage, Num_Bedrooms, Num_Bathrooms, Year_Built,
Lot_Size, Garage_Size, Neighborhood_Quality, House_Price.

The dataset is included in the repository.  


## Project Structure

notebooks:
1. Data ingestion  – Loading and initial inspection of the dataset
2. Full data analysis – Exploring patterns, correlations, and outliers
3. Preprocessing & feature engineering – Cleaning data and creating meaningful features
4. Model training – Building and evaluating predictive model




## Model Performance

- R² score: 0.998
- Root Mean Square Error:  Very low relative to price scale

The model captures most of the variation in housing prices.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete workflow combining deep data analysis with predictive modeling.  
The insights from analysis guided feature engineering and model selection.
